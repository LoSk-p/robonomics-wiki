Basically sending \"ON\" will result in `true` state for a device, anything else will result in `false`.\n\n> For the examples the development network is used. Check [this](/docs/rio-overview/#local-testnet) out to set it up for yourself\n\n## Requirements\n\n* `robonomics` [executable](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases)\n* Account on parachain \n\n## Create an Account\n\nHere the [development](/docs/rio-overview/#local-testnet) network is used, but the steps stay the same for the public network\n\nGo to \"Accounts\":\n\n![Robonomics Dapp Accounts](./images/robonomics-dapp-accounts.jpg \"Robonomics Dapp Accounts\")\n\nClick \"Add account\", give a name, change \"Mnemonic\" to \"Raw seed\", put a password and click \"Save\". \n\nNote! It's important to save \"Raw seed\" somewhere! It'll be used in `robonomics io` call\n\n![Robonomics Dapp Add Account](./images/robonomics-dapp-add-account.jpg \"Robonomics Dapp Add Account\")\n\nThe last thing to do is to transfer some tokens to the newly created account:\n\n![Robonomics Dapp Transfer Funds](./images/robonomics-dapp-transfer-unit.jpg \"Robonomics Dapp Transfer Funds\")\n\n## Usage \n\nTo see the result of transaction first of all run `read` part:\n\n```\n% ./robonomics io read launch\n```\n\nIf you have a remote node, specify the address via `--remote` option.\n\nNow let's turn a robot on:\n\n```\n% echo \"ON\" | ./robonomics io write launch -r 5CiPPseXPECbkjWCa6MnjNokrgYjMqmKndv2rSnekmSK2DjL -s 0xb046fc3c322e91e14a61ad4f08a3809ee0de7092e73aa9b3c2b642a0f476d4d6\n0c71f523533445ea193223e635448b6186899270ae1dd0dd8ad21b56d7870fa3\n```\n\nThen you should see in the first terminal window:\n\n```\n% ./robonomics io read launch\n5H3iRnX16DH2sb2RLxMM8UhDZTvJjP84EhhKXv3sCiEDq6bH >> 5CiPPseXPECbkjWCa6MnjNokrgYjMqmKndv2rSnekmSK2DjL : true\n```\n\nLet's describe all the accounts and options above. \n\n* `-r 5CiPPseXPECbkjWCa6MnjNokrgYjMqmKndv2rSnekmSK2DjL` means robot's address\n* `-s 0xb046fc3c322e91e14a61ad4f08a3809ee0de7092e73aa9b3c2b642a0f476d4d6` private key of the account to launch from (must have tokens for a transaction)\n* `5H3iRnX16DH2sb2RLxMM8UhDZTvJjP84EhhKXv3sCiEDq6bH` address that launches a robot\n* `5CiPPseXPECbkjWCa6MnjNokrgYjMqmKndv2rSnekmSK2DjL` robot's address\n* `true` turn it on\n\nIf we pass anything else but \"ON\" the state becomes `false`\n\n"}},"context":{}}
