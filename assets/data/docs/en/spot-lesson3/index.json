A world object is considered a higher-level item in the scene that has some amount of semantic information associated with it. More information you can find in [Robot Services](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/robot_services#world-object) tab in documentation.\n\nUsing world object service you can find fiducials near the spot. \n\n> Spot can find objects around faster if he stands.\n\nIn the task you will need find fiducials' coordinates and go to them. How to go to the local coordinates you can learn from [Lesson 2](/docs/spot-lesson2). The example of how to find fiducial and it's coordinates is in [fiducial_follow example](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk/blob/7ce5c5f31f4e1e45e9ff4be29fb097e258b75919/python/examples/fiducial_follow/fiducial_follow.py).\n\n1. Firstly, you need to find fiducial object with World Object Service:\n```python\nfiducial_objects = world_object_client.list_world_objects(\n            object_type=[world_object_pb2.WORLD_OBJECT_APRILTAG]).world_objects\n```\n2. Then get fiducial coordinates in a visual frame:\n```python\nfiducial = fiducial_objects[0]\nvision_tform_fiducial = get_a_tform_b(fiducial.transforms_snapshot, VISION_FRAME_NAME,fiducial.apriltag_properties.frame_name_fiducial.to_proto()\n```\n\n## Task\n\nSpot is in the place with some fiducials around. You need detect at least two fiducials and come to each of them within 1 m.\n\n\n"}},"context":{}}
