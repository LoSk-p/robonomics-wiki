Find and follow an object, navigate between them\n\nIn the third lesson you will learn how to find World Objects and go to them.\n\n## Requirements\n\nEnsure you have Yggdrasil Network software running and configured as described in the [Lesson 0](/docs/spot-lesson0). Otherwise you will not have connection to the robot.\n\n> On macOS you may need to launch Yggdrasil Network in the terminal:\n> ```bash\n> sudo yggdrasil -useconffile /etc/yggdrasil.conf\n> ```\n\n## Theory\n\nSpot has the World Object Service that provides a way to track and store objects detected in the world around Spot. A world object is considered a higher-level item in the scene that has some amount of semantic information associated with it. More information you can find in [Robot Services](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/robot_services#world-object) tab in Spot SDK documentation.\n\nUsing world object service you can find fiducials near the spot. \n\n> Spot can find objects around faster if he stands.\n\nIn the task you will need find fiducials' coordinates and go to them. You already know how to move to the local coordinates from the [Lesson 2](/docs/en/spot-lesson2.md). The example of how to find a fiducial and it's coordinates is in [fiducial_follow example](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk/blob/7ce5c5f31f4e1e45e9ff4be29fb097e258b75919/python/examples/fiducial_follow/fiducial_follow.py).\n\nIn your script, firstly, you need to find fiducial object with World Object Service:\n\n```python\nfiducial_objects = world_object_client.list_world_objects(\n            object_type=[world_object_pb2.WORLD_OBJECT_APRILTAG]).world_objects\n```\n\nThen get fiducial coordinates in a visual frame:\n\n```python\nfiducial = fiducial_objects[0]\nvision_tform_fiducial = get_a_tform_b(fiducial.transforms_snapshot, VISION_FRAME_NAME,fiducial.apriltag_properties.frame_name_fiducial.to_proto()\n```\n\n## The challenge\n\nSpot is in the place with some fiducials around. You need detect at least two fiducials and come to each of them within 1 m.\n"}},"context":{}}
