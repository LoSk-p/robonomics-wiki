A world object is considered a higher-level item in the scene that has some amount of semantic information associated with it. More information you can find in [Robot Services](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/robot_services#world-object) tab in documentation.\n\nUsing world object service you can find fiducials near the spot. \n\n> Spot can find objects around faster if he stands.\n\nThe example of how to find fiducial and it's coordinates is in [fiducial_follow example](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk/blob/7ce5c5f31f4e1e45e9ff4be29fb097e258b75919/python/examples/fiducial_follow/fiducial_follow.py#L418).\n\n## Task\n\nSpot is in the place with some fiducials around. You need detect at least two fiducials and come to each of them within 1 m.\n\n\n"}},"context":{}}
