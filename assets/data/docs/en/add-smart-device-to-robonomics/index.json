Integration use IPFS to store data and send IPFS hash in datalog or launch.\n\n## Configure\n\nNow you can add integration to Home Assistant. In web interface go to `Settings/Device & Services` and press `Add Integration`. Find there `Robonomics`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-integration.jpg\" />\n\nClick on it and fill the configuration. Here you need to add seed from `SUB_ADMIN` snd `SUB_OWNER` accounts (it must be ED25519 type, so don't forget to check the boxes under your seeds). You can find the instructions on how to create the account with ED25519 type [here](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/create-account-in-dapp/#2-directly-on-robonomics-parachain-app) Also you can set sending interval, by default it is 10 minutes.\n\nMoreover, you can add your Pinata credentials. It is not nessessary, if you will not do it, data will be pinned with your local node and Infura. If you add it, files also will be pinned in Pinata, it may help to faster access it.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/cobfiguration.jpg\" />\n\n## Use DApp\n\nNow you can use `SmartHome Telemetry` DApp to control your home through the Robonomics. You can find it in [Robonomics services](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services). Both accounts `SUB_ADMIN` and `SUB_OWNER` must be [added](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/create-account-in-dapp/#2.3-add-ed25519-account-to-polkadot-extention) to the [Polkadot extention](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).\n\n### Send commands\n\nTo control your home you need to know `entity id` of your device, `Platform` and service `Name` you want to call. You can find it in your Home Assistant. \n\nTo find `entity id` and `Platform` go to `Settings / Devices & Services / Entities`, here is a list of all entities in your Home Assistant. \n\n![entities](../images/home-assistant/entities-list.jpg)\n\n`Platform` is the first part of the entity id (before the dot). For example, if I want to control `bedroom switch 1` from the picture, entity id is `switch.bedroom_switch_switch_l1` and `Platform` is `switch`.\n\nThen in `Developer Tools / Services` find the services for your platform. Service `Name` here is after platform name, for example, `turn_on` or `toggle`:\n\n![services](../images/home-assistant/services.jpg)\n\nAlso you can add some other parameters (light color or temperature, for instanse). To find description of parameters choose the service and press `Go to YAML mode`.","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"en/add-smart-device-to-robonomics.md","name":"add-smart-device-to-robonomics"}}},"context":{}}
