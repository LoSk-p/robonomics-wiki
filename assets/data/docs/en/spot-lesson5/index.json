Read more about behavior trees in [Mission Service](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/autonomy/missions_service) page.\n\nYou can find information about Node types in [Behavior Tree Node Types](/docs/spot-behavior-tree-node-types) page.\n\n## Task\n\nYou need to create autonomous mission for Spot using behavior trees. In the mission Spot must:\n1. Stand up.\n2. Ask operator (you) what waypoint should it go to.\n3. Go to choosen waypoint.\n4. At the waypoint repeat steps 2 and 3.\n5. During all mission monitor the battery status and if battery power is lower than the value from task (in the `lesson` folder), ask operator if Spot shoul stop mission or continue.\n6. If the answer will be `Stop`, spot must take a battery change pose.\n\n> Use the mission from previous lesson or if you haven't saved it use mission from the `lessons` folder.\n\nThe example of how to ask and answer thw questions you can find in [mission_question_answerer](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk/tree/master/python/examples/mission_question_answerer)."}},"context":{}}
