Then you need to stake some tokens to make subscriptions available (in life network it works the same way: new subscriptions appears when there is some amount of tokens in the stake). Go to `Developer/Extrinsic`:\n\n![extrinsic](../images/dev-node/extrinsic.png)\n\nChoose created account and extrinsic `bond` and write amount of units (stake about 1000000000000 to create subscription):\n\n![stake](../images/dev-node/stake.png)\n\nThen press `Submit Transaction`.\n\nAfter that in `Developer/Chain state` you can see auctions for subscriptions (to get a subscription you need to win a small auction). Choose `rws` and `auctionQueue` and press `+` button, you will see ids of available auctions:\n\n![queue](../images/dev-node/queue.png)\n\nYou can see information about any subscription with `rws` `auction` and id of auction (in the picture auction with id 0):\n\n![auction](../images/dev-node/auction.png)\n\nIn the information about auction you can see `winner` field, now it is `null` so nobody now have subscription with id 0 and we can get it. For that go to `Developer/Extrinsic`, choose your account and `rws` `bid`. Also set auction id (0) and amount of units to bid (more than 1000000000):\n\n![bid](../images/dev-node/bid.png)\n\nSubmit transaction and check the information about auction with id 0 (in `Chain state` choose `rws`, `auction` and id 0):\n\n![win](../images/dev-node/auc_win.png)\n\nNow in `winner` field you will see your account address, it means that this account have subscription 0. Auction starts with the first bid and lasts a few blocks, so if somebody bid more tokens than you in the next few blocks he will be the winner and he will take subscription.\n\nNow you can add devices. Devices are accounts that will be able to use this subscription and send extrinsics with no fee. To test it lets create new account with no tokens and add it to devices. \n\nTo add devices in `Developer/Extrinsic` choose `rws` and `setDevices`. The press `Add Item` button and choose recently created account with no tokens:\n\n![set_devices](../images/dev-node/set_devices.png)\n\nSubmit transaction. Now you can check list of devices in `Chain state` with `rws` `devices`. There you will see the address of your account without tokens. Choose the account that has bought the subscription and press `+`:\n\n![devices](../images/dev-node/devices.png)\n\nNow lets try to send datalog extrinsic from account without tokens. Go to `Extrinsic`, choose this account and `rws` `call`. Then in `subscriptionID` field choose the first account (one that bought subscription) and in the next field choose `datalog` and `record`. Write anything in the last field and submit transaction:\n\n![datalog](../images/dev-node/datalog.png)\n\nNow go to `Network/Explorer` and in the `Recent Events` you will see two events `rws.NewCall` and `datalog.NewRecord`:\n\n![events](../images/dev-node/events.png)"}},"context":{}}
