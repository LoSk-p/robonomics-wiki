For that, edit the Yggdrasil configuration file with this command in a terminal:\n\n### For MacOS and Linux:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/yggdrasil.conf\n```\n\n### For Windows \nRun `updateconfig.bat` in `C:/Program Files/Yggdrasil`. \n\nThen in `C:/ProgramData/Yggdrasil` open `yggdrasil.conf` with any text editor.\n\n---\n\nIn the file that you opened add 5-6 peers geografically near to you. You can find list of available peers [here](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/public-peers) or add peers from example below. Example in yggdrasil.conf:\n\n```bash\n  Peers:\n  [\n    tcp://213.188.199.150:10010\n    tcp://213.188.210.9:10010\n    tcp://[2a09:8280:1::3:312]:10010\n    tcp://[2a09:8280:1::a:2e2]:10010\n    tcp://46.151.26.194:60575\n    tcp://ygg-ru.cofob.ru:18000\n    tcp://ygg.tomasgl.ru:61933\n    tls://185.22.60.71:8443\n    tcp://51.15.118.10:62486\n    tls://ygg.loskiq.dev:17314\n    tls://longseason.1200bps.xyz:13122\n  ]\n  ```\nCheck if the peers online in [Puplic Peers](https://publicpeers.neilalexander.dev/).\n\n### For Linux:\n\nThen restart Yggdrasil using this command:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl restart yggdrasil\n```\n### For macOS:\n\nUnload the service and run Yggdrasil with changed config file:\n\n```bash\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/yggdrasil.plist\nsudo yggdrasil -useconffile /etc/yggdrasil.conf\n```\n> You will need to do that before every lesson.\n\n### For Windows\n\nPress win + r and type `services.msc`, find Yggdrasil service, open it and restart (press Stop and Start).\n\n![win-service](../images/spot/spot-windows.jpg)\n\n## Check Connection\n\nCheck if Yggdrasil works well. For that try to connect to Spot via this link: https://[200:2fba:a23a:9d37:7e2b:3303:ca4e:208f]:21443. If you see authentication page, you are ready to connect to Spot and do next lessons.\n\n> If you can't open page in MacOS try to use another browser.\n\n![log_in](../images/spot/less1-login.jpg)\n\nIf you don't see this page or you had any errors during the Yggdrasil setup look in [Troubleshooting page](/docs/spot-troubleshooting). If you can't find the solution there, please email spot@robonomics.network."}},"context":{}}
