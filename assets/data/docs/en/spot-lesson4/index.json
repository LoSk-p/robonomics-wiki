Collectively, this service is referred to as GraphNav. Maps are recorded and saved and later can be replayed with any robot in your fleet. During the map recording process, you can assign actions and API callbacks to waypoints along the map route.\n\nRead [GraphNav Tech Summary](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/autonomy/graphnav_tech_summary) to learn how it works. [Initialisation](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/autonomy/initialization) is also important part, it will be usefull in this lesson.\n\n> You can view recorded maps with [View Map](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk/tree/master/python/examples/graph_nav_view_map) example. For that you need to copy the map to your computer:\n> ```bash\n> scp -r student@\\[200:2fba:a23a:9d37:7e2b:3303:ca4e:208f\\]:<path_to_the_map_on_spot> <path_to_the_map_to_download>\n> ``` \n> Also you need [install spot packages](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk/blob/master/docs/python/quickstart.md#install-spot-python-packages).\n\n## Task \n\nYou need to record a map avoiding obstacles and make spot go from start point to end point. Save your mission in `/home/student/result`.\n\nYou can use examples of [recording and playing missions](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk/tree/master/python/examples/graph_nav_command_line).\n"}},"context":{}}
