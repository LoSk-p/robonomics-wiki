Go to this link (https://[200:c32a:e1ac:1da2:15ed:626f:c1e0:36ed]:21443) and log in with your username and password (you can do that only with working yggdrasil). \n\nThen go to `terminal` tab. There you can use python spot-sdk to control Spot.\n\n![terminal](../images/spot/less1-terminal.png)\n\nAlso you can see what the robot is doing in real-time livestream (http://[200:b99e:a736:e3bf:744c:6acb:ec11:9dc]:8081/0/stream).\n\n## Documentation\n\nRead [Understanding Spot Programming](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/python/understanding_spot_programming) page in spot-sdk documentation and follow the steps.\n\nFor Spot authentication use the same username and password as for Core. Spot address is `192.168.50.3`.\n\n> Use `python3` instead of `python`\n\n> In [Taking ownership of Spot (Leases)](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/python/understanding_spot_programming#taking-ownership-of-spot-leases) section use `lease = lease_client.acquire()` before `lease_keep_alive = bosdyn.client.lease.LeaseKeepAlive(lease_client)`\n\nYou can find more detailed information for this lesson in [Base Services](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/base_services), [Geometry and Frames](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/geometry_and_frames), [Robot Services](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/robot_services) and [E-Stop](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/estop_service) sections of spot-sdk documentation.\n\n## Task\n\nIn the first lesson you need to change Spot's body position to make it trace your initials with it's face. For that, you will have to experiment with different body positions. The range of Pitch, Yaw and Roll is from -0.5 to 0.5.\n\n## Results\n\nWe'll send the rosbag file to your e-mail.\n"}},"context":{}}
