Install it:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update -y && sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients -y\n```\n\nIt will be started automatically, check it:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status mosquitto\n```\n\n![mosquitto](../images/home-assistant/mosquitto.png)\n\n## MQTT Integration\n\nThen you need to add MQTT integration to Home Assistant. Go to `Configuration/Integrations` and press `Add Integration` button. Find MQTT:\n\n![mqtt](../images/home-assistant/mqtt.png)\n\nPress on it and set up your brocker with address (localhost) and port (1883) and press `submit`:\n\n![mqtt1](../images/home-assistant/mqtt1.png)\n\nThen press on three dots on MQTT integration and choose `System Options`:\n\n![mqtt_options](../images/home-assistant/mqtt_conf.png)\n\nAnd check if automatically adding new devices is enabled:\n\n![mqtt_dev](../images/home-assistant/add_dev.png)\n\n## MQTT on SLS Gateway\n\nAlso you need to configure MQTT on SLS Gateway. On your SLS Gateway go to `MQTT Setup`:\n\n![sls-mqtt](../images/home-assistant/sls-mqtt.jpg)\n\nAnd add your brocker address (address of the raspberry with Home Assistant in local network) and port (1883). Also write the topic name (you can choose any):\n\n![sls-mqtt1](../images/home-assistant/sls-mqtt1.jpg)\n\nSave changes. Then you need to configure SLS Gateway for automatically adding devices to Home Assistant. Go to `Zigbee/Config` and tick `Home Assistant MQTT Discovery`:\n\n![sls-hass](../images/home-assistant/sls-hass.png)\n\nSave changes and reboot gateway. If devices was connected before this, you should reconnect them. After that devices will be automatically shown in Home Assistant."}},"context":{}}
