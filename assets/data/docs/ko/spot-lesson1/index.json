Go to this link (https://[200:c32a:e1ac:1da2:15ed:626f:c1e0:36ed]:21443) and log in with your username and password (you can do that only with working yggdrasil). \n\n![log_in](../images/spot/less1-login.jpg)\n\nThen go to `terminal` tab. There you can use python spot-sdk to control Spot.\n\n![terminal](../images/spot/less1-terminal.png)\n\nAlso you can see what robot do in real time stream (http://[200:b99e:a736:e3bf:744c:6acb:ec11:9dc]:8081/0/stream).\n\n## Documentation\n\nRead [Understanding Spot Programming](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/python/understanding_spot_programming) page in spot-sdk documentation and follow the steps.\n\nFor Spot authentication use the same username and password as for Core. Spot address is `192.168.50.3`.\n\n> Use `python3` instead of `python`\n\n> In [Taking ownership of Spot (Leases)](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/python/understanding_spot_programming#taking-ownership-of-spot-leases) section use `lease = lease_client.acquire()` before `lease_keep_alive = bosdyn.client.lease.LeaseKeepAlive(lease_client)`\n\nYou can find more detailed information for this lesson in [Base Services](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/base_services), [Geometry and Frames](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/geometry_and_frames), [Robot Services](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/robot_services) and [E-Stop](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/estop_service) sections of spot-sdk documentation.\n\n## Task\n\nIn the first lesson you need to change Spot's body position to make him write your initials by his head.
